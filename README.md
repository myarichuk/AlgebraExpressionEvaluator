# Algebra Expressions Evaluator
This is a simple demo project created to show a simple and understandable example how ANTLR4 parser can be created and used

## Compiling the project
Note that in order to compile this project, you will need to generate C# parser and lexer code with ANTLR4. 
You can do this manually by using the ANTLR4 directly (take a look at [this tutorial](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md))

#### For VS2017
Alternatively, if you use VS2017 you can use a [VS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SamHarwell.ANTLRLanguageSupport) that would automate parser and lexer generation.  

#### For VS2019
Unfortunately, the above extension doesn't work for VS2019. There is another [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KenDomino.AntlrVSIX) that can do the job, albeit with a bit inferior syntax highlighting.
